:::tip[SplashKit resource bundles allow you to quickly and easily load a number of resources in the `Resources` folder.]
Supports the loading and freeing of game resource bundles. Resource types include images, sounds, music and animation files to name a few. Resource files must be saved in specific locations of a Resources folder for your game.
