Follow these steps to set up SplashKit on Linux and start building interactive, visually engaging applications quickly and easily!

## Installation Steps

1. **Run the SplashKit Installer**

   Open your Terminal and paste the following command to download and install SplashKit:

    ```shell
    bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splashkit/skm/master/install-scripts/skm-install.sh)
    ```

2. **Restart the Terminal and Test the Installation**

   After restarting the terminal, run the following command to confirm the installation:

    ```shell
    skm
    ```

    You should see messages similar to:

    ```shell
    SplashKit is installed successfully!
    Missing skm command. For help use 'skm help'
    ```
