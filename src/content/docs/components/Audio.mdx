:::tip[SplashKit Audio allows you to load and play music and sound effects.]
SplashKit's audio library allows you to easily load and play music and sound effects within your programs. To get started with audio the first thing you need to do is load a sound effect or music file. You can do this by calling the Load Sound Effect(string Name) function to the Load Music(string Name) function.
